## What it is about.

The repository is dedicated to small practicing in Java. I work with all the code here without IDE and auto completeions/siggestions. It's some kind of challenge for me to fell myself better in coding on Java.
I'm planing to add here as much different algorithms as it possible. 
It will be a complete reference for me and a good practice on the other hand.
When I started doing that I was using a Vim editor, and then I had decided to use Sublime Text instead (I turened off auto complete of course).

## How to compile and run

1. Navigate to the directory `vim-practice`
1. From this place run a command in terminal `javac -classpath . space/eignatik/*.java`
1. Then after compilation run a command `java -cp . space.eignatik.Main`

Then you will see the result in the standard output.
